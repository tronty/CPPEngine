#Minecraft Turtles 3D

![Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/8MWMiiQ.jpg)

We've been using the Raspberry Pi edition of Minecraft in our [Code Club](https://www.codeclub.org.uk/) and trying out the the [MCPiPy API](http://mcpipy.com).

This is an attempt to recreate [LOGO Turtle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)#Turtle_and_graphics) movements in Minecraft, by placing blocks along their paths. Still very basic.

(Not to be mixed up with the Turtles of the Computercraft Mod: [http://computercraft.info/wiki/Turtle](http://computercraft.info/wiki/Turtle))

MCPiPy, and therefore Minecraft Turtles, can also be used with the standard PC version of Minecraft. You will need a [CraftBukkit](https://dl.bukkit.org/downloads/craftbukkit/) server running the [Raspberry Juice plugin](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/raspberryjuice/). There is a [good blog post](http://mcpipy.wordpress.com/2013/02/13/running-python-programs-without-a-raspberry-pi/) on the MCPiPy website describing the steps to do this.

##Installation
```
git clone --recursive git@github.com:tombh/mc-turtles.git
```

If your Minecraft server is a different machine from where you are using this code then you can set custom values for the server's address and port in `settings.py`. You can copy `settings.py.sample` as a starting point.

To draw a flower in your Minecraft world simply issue: `python flowers.py`

##Examples

**Hello World**
```python
from turtlecraft import Turtlecraft
T = Turtlecraft()
T.chat("Hello World")
```

**Basic Commands**
```python
# Move the turtle forward
T.fd(steps)
# Rotate the turtle right or left
T.rt(angle)
T.lt(angle)
# Tilt the turtle forwards and backwards
T.tilt_fd(angle)
T.tilt_bk(angle)

# Set an area the size of <square_length>^3 to the AIR block
T.clear(cubic_length)

# Set the current block type. Similar to traditional turtle's pencolor()
# There are hundreds of block types, but for now just added a list of possible blocks:  
#['GRASS','AIR','DIRT','STONE','TNT','GOLD_ORE','LAVA','MELON'] 
# Default is Grass
T.setBT(blocktype)

# Pen up / pen down - While moving the turtle leaves a trail of blocks or not
T.pu()
T.pd()
```

**Accessing the turtle's properties**
```python
# It can be useful to find out where your turtle is (it's invisible so far!)
T.Turtle.getTilePos() 
#You can also set its position
T.Turtle.setPos(x,y,z)
# What block type is set at the moment?
T.Turtle.getBlockType()
# Which direction is the turtle facing?
T.Turtle.getDir()
```

##Contributing

Feedback and PRs are very welcome.

To run tests you will need some dependencies, so Virtualenv can be useful for that:

```bash
# In the project root:
virtuaenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
# To run tests:
nosetests spec/*
```
