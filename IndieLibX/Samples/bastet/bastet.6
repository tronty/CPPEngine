.TH BASTET 6 "FEBRUARY 2009"
.SH NAME
bastet \- Tetris(r) clone with "bastard" block-choosing AI
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bastet
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B bastet
(short for "bastard tetris") is a Tetris(r) clone which tries to
give you the worst possible block. Playing bastet can be
a painful experience, especially if you usually make "canyons" and wait for
the long I-shaped block.
.SH USAGE
.B bastet
tries to conform as much as possible to the tetris guidelines. We refer to those for the rules of the game. In the starting menu, you can configure the key bindings; the default ones are:
.IP DOWN
moves the tetromino down (one single step)
.IP LEFT
moves the tetromino left
.IP RIGHT
moves the tetromino right
.IP SPACE
rotates CW
.IP UP
rotates CCW
.IP ENTER
drops the tetromino as far down as possible (hard drop)
.IP P
pauses the game
.IP CTRL+C
exits the game without any further prompt

.SH PLAYING MODES
The game includes two playing modes. In the second one (harder), you do not get the preview of the next tetromino, and the algorithm is modified to take advantage of this.
