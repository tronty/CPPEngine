This Agreement constitutes the sole and entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Software, and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations and warranties, both written and oral, with respect to the Software. This Agreement may only be amended, modified or supplemented by an agreement in writing by non-preprinted agreements clearly understood by both parties to be an amendment and signed by each party hereto. No waiver by either party of any of the provisions hereof shall be effective unless explicitly set forth in writing and signed by the party so waiving.

You acknowledge and agree that a material breach of this Agreement would cause irreparable injury to Esoteric Software for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy and that, in the event of any actual or threatened material breach of this Agreement by You, Esoteric Software shall be entitled to temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief against You and Your officers or employees, without the requirement of posting a bond or proving actual damages, in addition to whatever remedies Esoteric Software might have at law. Esoteric Software may subcontract this Agreement, or any part thereof, including support, to subcontractors selected by Esoteric Software and may freely assign or otherwise transfer all or any of its rights, or delegate or otherwise transfer all or any of its obligations or performance, under this Agreement without Your consent. You may not assign or otherwise transfer any of Your rights, or delegate or otherwise transfer any of Your obligations under this Agreement, in each case whether voluntarily, involuntarily, by operation of law or otherwise, without Esoteric Software's prior written consent. This Agreement is binding upon and inures to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns.
