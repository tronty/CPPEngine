For the purposes of this Agreement, the following terms are defined and used in this document:

- **"Application"** means machine-executable software, using, or created in part using, 
  any part of the Software (or any part of a Derivative Work), and provided to end-users 
  to provide functionality through some form of non-programming user interface, and which
  is not considered to be a Derivative Work.

- **"API"** means the programming interface through which developers gain access to any part
  of the functionality of a framework, library, application, or other software.

- **"Brenwill"**, **"We"**, **"Us"**, and **"Our"** mean **The Brenwill Workshop Ltd**. 

- **"Derivative Work"** means any framework, library, application, tool, game engine, or other 
  software, created in part using any part of the Software, and exposing an API to Developers

- **"Developer"** means a single person who uses or includes any part of the Software 
  (or any part of a Derivative Work) as part of building an Application or Derivative Work
  using any form of developer tools. For clarity, Developer includes any programmer, 
  tester, manager, demonstrator, marketing staff, sales staff, agent, contractor, customer, 
  third party, or any other person who performs these activities (even occasionally), 
  but does not include end-users of an Application, or any of the aforementioned persons 
  who uses a pre-built and finished Application solely in the capacity of an end-user.

- **"Documentation"** means the human-readable instructions, descriptions, explanations, 
  specifications, drawings, images, and other documentation related to the use of the 
  Software, and provided by Us, either along with the Software, or separately, to support 
  Your use of the Software.

- **"Framework"** and **"Library"** mean a machine-executable component part of the Software 
  (or a Derivative Work) that is designed and intended to be integrated into an Application 
  or Derivative Work as an integral and indivisible part of an Application or Derivative Work,
  and is conspicuously identified as being intended for such purpose, through naming, or through
  notice of such purpose in the Documentation.

- **"License"** and **"Agreement"** mean this license agreement, which forms a legally binding
  agreement between You and Us.

- **"License Fee"** means the payment made from You to Us, in an amount defined by Us, 
  as consideration for Your use of the Software as described in this Agreement.

- **"Software"** means the files and functionality distributed, in whole or in part, 
  by Us or Our authorized representatives as **Molten**, **MoltenVK**, and/or **MoltenGL**.

- **"You"** and **"Your"** mean the person, company, or other entity who is being licensed
  to use the Software.



License Grant, Title and Term
-----------------------------

We hereby grant You a non-exclusive license for use of the Software by a single Developer.

We retain all ownership, right, title, copyright, naming rights, trademarks, and interest in
the Software and Documentation, including all component source code, compiled code, Libraries, 
documents, examples, tutorials, images, photographs, videos, and any other components of the
Software and Documentation.

From time to time, We may make available updates and upgrades to the Software and Documentation 
and, unless otherwise indicated, this License will apply to the original version of the Software 
obtained by You, and to all updates and upgrades, until such time as We, at Our sole discretion,
determine that an upgrade contains enough significant additional functionality as to require
the acquisition of a separate License. This License will continue to apply to the original 
version and any updates and upgrades previously acquired by You.

As the requirements for future versions of the Software may change, We reserve the right to
unilaterally modify the terms and conditions of this Agreement for any future version, update,
or upgrade of the Software.

Unless identified otherwise, this Agreement is effective immediately and will remain in 
effect in perpetuity. You may terminate this Agreement at any time by immediately destroying 
all copies of the Software and Documentation in Your possession or control. This Agreement 
will automatically terminate if You fail to comply with any material term or condition of 
this Agreement. You agree, upon termination of this Agreement, by either You or Us, and for 
any reason, to immediately destroy all copies of the Software and Documentation in Your 
possession or control.

All restrictions listed in the **What You May Not Do** section of this Agreement will
survive the termination of this Agreement.

This Agreement may be modified only by a writing signed by You and Us. This Agreement and 
all related actions and proceedings will be governed by the laws of the Province of Ontario
and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein without regard to conflicts of laws 
provisions, and without regard to the United Nations Convention on the International Sale 
of Goods, and the parties consent to the jurisdiction of the courts in the City of Toronto 
in the Province of Ontario, Canada. In the event of litigation between You and Us concerning 
this Agreement, the prevailing party in the litigation will be entitled to recover legal 
fees and expenses from the other party.

If any provision of this Agreement will be adjudged by any court of competent jurisdiction 
to be unenforceable or invalid, then that provision will be stricken from this Agreement 
without affecting the rest of this Agreement, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement 
will continue to be valid and enforceable.



What You May Do

  using your Derivative Work must adhere to the terms of this License. You may repeat this for any
  number of Derivative Works.

Limited Warranty and Remedy
---------------------------

We warrant that for a period of 90 days after delivery of this copy of the Software to You, 
the Software will perform in material compliance with the Documentation.

We represent and warrant that We are the copyright holder of the Software and Documentation, 
that the granting of this License does not violate any other agreement, copyright, or ownership
right, and that We are not aware of any claims or allegations that any or all of the Software
infringes, violates, or misappropriates the intellectual property rights of any third party.

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, THE FOREGOING LIMITED WARRANTY IS IN LIEU 
OF ALL OTHER WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AND WE DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, 
MERCHANTABILITY, PERFORMANCE, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, regardless of whether We 
know or had reason to know of Your particular needs. No employee, agent, dealer or distributor
of Ours is authorized to modify this limited warranty, nor to make any additional warranties.

Our entire liability and Your exclusive remedy for breach of the foregoing warranty will be, 
at Our option, to  repair or replace the Software or refund the purchase price.

IN NO EVENT WILL WE BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY LOST PROFITS, LOST SAVINGS,
BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, PERSONAL INJURY, LOSS OF PRIVACY, OR OTHER INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL 
DAMAGES ARISING FROM THE USE OR THE INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE (EVEN IF WE OR AN AUTHORIZED
DEALER OR DISTRIBUTOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF THESE DAMAGES), OR FOR ANY CLAIM 
BY ANY OTHER PARTY. Some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability 
for incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations may not apply to You.

You may not use the Software in a situation where the Software's failure to perform can 
reasonably be expected to result in physical injury or loss of life. Any such use by You
is entirely at Your own risk, and You agree to hold Us harmless from any claims or losses
relating to such unauthorized use.



Confidentiality and Indemnification
-----------------------------------

The Software and Documentation contain trade secrets and proprietary intellectual property 
that belong to Us and it is being made available to You in strict confidence. ANY USE OR 
DISCLOSURE OF THE SOFTWARE, OR OF ITS ALGORITHMS, PROTOCOLS OR INTERFACES, OTHER THAN IN 
STRICT ACCORDANCE WITH THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT, MAY BE ACTIONABLE AS A VIOLATION OF OUR 
TRADE SECRET OR PATENT RIGHTS.

To the maximum extent permitted by law, You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Us,
Our affiliates, and Our and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents from
and against any and all claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as well as any and all losses, 
liabilities, damages, costs and expenses arising out of or accruing from Your use of the 
Software in a way that infringes any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress, patent
or other intellectual property right of any third party, or defames any third party or 
violates their rights of publicity or privacy.
