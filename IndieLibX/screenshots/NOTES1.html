<h1>IndieLibX NOTES1</h1>
<br>
<br>
There are probably serious errors in on the following four libraries and on the two terrain samples.<br>
1. assimp3_x library and MeshRenderer2 library: ParticleVS sample and 3DAnimation sample.<br>
2. spine_x library: testspine2 sample.<br>
3. otl library: appforest abd apptreeview samples. Overly complex otl library interface does not make work easier.<br>
4. RadeonTerrainDemo and NatureScene samples.<br>
<p>The solutions now compile also on OSX and on Windows after correcting some errors on Projects.xml, Projects.py and on some C++ source files.</p>
<p>The test.sh works now as best in Linux. On the OSX and on the Windows the individual make.sh/make.bat calls work better than the test.sh/test.bat calls as there are more runtime errors on these platforms which break the test.sh/test.bat.</p>
<p>After resetting mac back to factory settings and reinstalling Xcode I was able to compile and run <A TARGET="_blank" HREF="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/samplecode/GLEssentials/GLEssentials.zip">GLEssentials sample</A> in OSX and iOS simulator.</p>
<p>The NDK solutions are now built without compilation errors. More about SimpleTexture on NDK is documented in <A TARGET="_blank" HREF="SimpleTexture_on_NDK.html">SimpleTexture_on_NDK</a>.</p>
<p>The iOS solutions are now built without compilation errors. More about SimpleTexture on iOS is documented in <A TARGET="_blank" HREF="SimpleTexture_on_iOS.html">SimpleTexture_on_iOS</a>.</p>
