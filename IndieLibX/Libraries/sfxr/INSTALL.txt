You can build and install with either Automake or CMake.  Use CMake if you are not using Linux/Unix.

Automake:
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
sudo make install

CMake (not GUI):
cmake -G Unix\ Makefiles
make
sudo make install

Note the install is hardcoded to /usr, you can also run sfxr from the build
dir after make (./sfxr) without installing.
