.SH "NAME"
sfxr \- sound effects generator
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
This is a little tool made in connection with the 10th Ludum Dare competition held in December 2007\&. Its original purpose was to provide a simple means of getting basic sound effects into a game for those people who were working hard to get their entries done within the 48 hours and didn\(cqt have time to spend looking for suitable ways of doing this\&.
.sp
The idea was that they could just hit a few buttons in this application and get some largely randomized effects that were custom in the sense that the user could accept/reject each proposed sound\&.
.SH "BASIC USAGE"
.sp
Start the application, then hit some of the buttons on the left side to generate random sounds matching the button descriptions\&.
.sp
Press "Export \&.WAV" to save the current sound as a WAV audio file\&. Click the buttons below to change WAV format in terms of bits per sample and sample rate\&.
.sp
If you find a sound that is sort of interesting but not quite what you want, you can drag some sliders around until it sounds better\&.
.sp
The Randomize button generates something completely random\&.
.sp
Mutate slightly alters the current parameters to automatically create a variation of the sound\&.
.SH "ADVANCED USAGE"
.sp
Figure out what each slider does and use them to adjust particular aspects of the current sound\&...
.sp
Press the right mouse button on a slider to reset it to a value of zero\&.
.sp
Press Space or Enter to play the current sound\&.
.sp
The Save/Load sound buttons allow saving and loading of program parameters to work on a sound over several sessions\&.
.sp
Volume setting is saved with the sound and exported to WAV\&. If you increase it too much there\(cqs a risk of clipping\&.
.sp
Some parameters influence the sound during playback (particularly when using a non\-zero repeat speed), and dragging these sliders can cause some interesting effects\&. To record this you will need to use an external recording application, for instance Audacity\&. Set the recording source in that application to "Wave", "Stereo Mix", "Mixed Output" or similar\&.
.sp
Using an external sound editor to capture and edit sound can also be used to string several sounds together for more complex results\&.
.SH "SLIDER DESCRIPTIONS"
.PP
\fBSquarewave\fR, \fBSawtooth\fR, \fBSinewave\fR, \fBNoise\fR
.RS 4
Selects the base waveform\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBAttack time\fR
.RS 4
The beginning of the sound, longer attack means a smoother start\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBSustain time\fR
.RS 4
How long the volume is held constant before fading out\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBSustain punch\fR
.RS 4
Cause a popping effect with increased (and falling) volume during the sustain phase\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBDecay time\fR
.RS 4
Fade\-out time\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBStart frequency\fR
.RS 4
Starting frequency of the sample\&. Has a large impact on the overall sound\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBMin frequency\fR
.RS 4
Represents a cutoff that stops all sound if it\(cqs passed during a downward slide\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBSlide\fR
.RS 4
Sets the speed at which the frequency should be swept (up or down)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBDelta slide\fR
.RS 4
The "slide of slide", or rate of change in the slide speed\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBVibrato depth\fR, \fBVibrato speed\fR
.RS 4
Makes for an oscillating frequency effect at various strengths and rates\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBChange amount\fR
.RS 4
Pitch amount to change (up or down) after a certain delay\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBChange speed\fR
.RS 4
Time to wait before changing the pitch\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBSquare duty\fR
.RS 4
Describes its shape in terms of how large the positive versus negative sections are\&. This option applies to
\fBSquarewave\fR
waveforms only\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBDuty sweep\fR
.RS 4
Sweep amount of the waveform\&. This option applies to
\fBSquarewave\fR
waveforms only\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBRepeat speed\fR
.RS 4
When not zero, this parameter causes the frequency and duty parameters to be reset at regular intervals while the envelope and filter continue unhindered\&. This can make for some interesting pulsating effects\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBPhaser offset\fR
.RS 4
Overlay a delayed copy of the audio stream on top of itself, resulting in a kind of tight reverb or sci\-fi effect\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBPhaser sweep\fR
.RS 4
Sweep amount of the
\fBphaser offset\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBLP filter cutoff\fR
.RS 4
Set the cutoff for the lowpass filter\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBLP filter cutoff sweep\fR
.RS 4
Sweep amount for the
\fBLP filter cutoff\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBLP filter resonance\fR
.RS 4
Set the resonance for the lowpass filter\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBHP filter cutoff\fR
.RS 4
Set the cutoff for the highpass filter\&. It can be used to remove undesired low frequency hum in "light" sounds\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBHP filter cutoff sweep\fR
.RS 4
Sweep amount for the
\fBHP filter cutoff\fR\&.
