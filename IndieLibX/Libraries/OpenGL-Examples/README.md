OpenGL Example Collection
-------------------------

The purpose of thise example collection is to provide short and self
contained code that showcases OpenGL api functionality/features.
The examples have no dependencies on any custom framework or basecode
except for "canonical" libraries such as glfw, gl3w and glm. All the
examples are written against core profiles of version OpenGL version 3.3
or higher.

Most of the examples try to show the targeted features in a relevant
use case such as using Frame Buffer Objects for FXAA, Transform Feedback
to update particles on the GPU or Occlusion Queries + Conditional Render
to optimize rendering a Cube (Minecraftlike) Cave. At the same time
the goal is to keep the examples short and simple enough to not lose
the focus.

The build system is cmake (only tested on my linux box...). If everything
works as intended these commands should build the examples:
```
    git submodule init
    git submodule update
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ../
    make
```
