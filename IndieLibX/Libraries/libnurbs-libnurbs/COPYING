libnurbs is built upon a number of other open source libraries.
The original copyright information and license statements of each are
preserved below.

For the moment, because libnurbs is not using any code except that of
openNURBS, libnurbs in aggregate can be regarded as being licensed under 
the Modified BSD license - see doc/licenses/LIBNURBS-COPYING  

A final decision has not yet been made as to whether to utilize LGPL code
in implementing new functionality for openNURBS - until the benefits to
doing so are clear and compelling, Modified BSD will be preferred.

Below is a quick summary of the licenses of the various libraries that have been
utilized - for full text, see the doc/licenses directory.
