libfgen -- Fast and efficient genetic algorithm library. Version 0.2.2

**** Linux installation ****

In Linux, the code has been tested on x86-64 Linux, and on 32-bit ARM-based
systems. It should also work but has not been tested on 32-bit x86 systems. It is
compiled with -std-gnu99.

It is configured to be a shared library. The default installation directory for
the library and header files are /usr/lib and /usr/include, respectively. Edit
the file Makefile to change this.

To compile the library, run:

	make

To install the library, run:

	sudo make install

To make the example programs, run make in the examples/ subdirectory.

To make the graphical example program "pict", which uses GTK+ 3, run:

	make

in the examples/pict/ directory with the gtk-3.0 library development package
installed.

Likewise, to make the graphical TSP example program tsp_gtk, run make in the
examples/tsp_gtk/ directory.

Run make in the examples/gp/ directory to compile the linear genetic programming
example.

To make the documentation with doxygen installed, run:

	doxygen fgen.doxygen

The html documentation is installed in doc/html/.
Online documentation can be found at http://libfgen.sourceforge.net.

To use the library in your program, include fgen.h and link with -lfgen. Or
when using the C++ wrapper API (which is not really recommended), include
fgenpp.h and link with -lfgen -lfgenpp.

**** Windows installation ****

A Visual C++ 2010 project solution file for the 32-bit version is included.
This should enable building of a static library and the example programs
(except the gtk examples tsp_gtk and pict). Use the Release configuration.
After building the static libary will be found as libfgen/Release/libfgen.lib.
The header file is libfgen/fgen.h. The examples will be created as command-line
executables in libfgen/examples and libfgen/examples/gp. A precompiled version
of libfgen.lib is provided as libfgen/Release/libfgen.lib.

Libfgen for Windows requires the pthread_win32 library, the 32-bit version of
which is included in the pthread32_win32/ directory. When running programs
compiled with libfgen, the pthreadVC2.dll file should be installed in the PATH
(in a location like \windows\system32). When compiling programs,
link with libfgen.lib and pthreadVC2.lib.

The full source code and 64-bit libraries of pthread_win32 can be found at the
site http://sourceware.org/pthreads-win32/.

Note that libfgen and the example files are build in C++ mode in Visual C++
despite the source filenames ending in .c. This is because the source code
uses extensions of C defined by the C99 standard which are not supported by
Visual C++, but are supported in C++ mode. The relevant option is project
properties -> C/C++ -> Advanced -> Compile As = Compile as C++ Code.

The building of the GTK example program tsp_gtk in Windows requires a GTK 3
installation. All the include paths (the output of the GTK 3 package's
`pkgconfig --cflags gtk+-3.0` command) must be set in the Additional Include
Directories field of the source file gtk.c in the tsp_gtk project. Then,
all the .lib files from the GTK distribution must be added as Resource Files
for the project.

It is also possible to use MinGW, the a GNU development environment for
Windows. When using MinGW, run make -f Makefile.MinGW in the libfgen/
directory to compile the libary. Provided GTK 3 is installed with a working
pkg-config in the PATH, the graphical examples should also compile.
