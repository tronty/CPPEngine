WhirlGIF 2.01

whirlgif is a quick program that reads a series of GIF files, and produces
a single gif file composed of those images.

Usage:
	whirlgif [-v] [-trans index ] [-time delay] [-o outfile]
		 [-loop] [-i incfile] file1 [ -time delay] file2

options:
		-v	   	verbose mode    
		-loop [count]	add the Netscape 'loop' extension.
		-time delay	inter-frame timing.
		-disp [method]	Set disposal method, see below
		-trans index	set the colormap index 'index' to be transparent
		-o outfile	write the results to 'outfile'
		-i incfile	read a list of names from 'incfile'

TIPS

If you don't specify an output file, the GIF will be sent to stdout. This is
a good thing if you're using this in a CGI script, a very bad thing if you
run this from a terminal and forget to redirect stdout.

The output file (if any) and -loop _MUST_ be specified before any gif images.

You can specify several delay statements on the command line to change
the delay between images in the middle of an animation, e.g.

	whirlgif -time 5 a.gif b.gif c.gif -time 100 d.gif -time 5 e.gif f.gif

Although it's generally considered to be evil, you can also specify
several transparency statements on the command line, to change the transparent
color in the middle of an animation. This may cause problems for some programs.

DISPOSAL METHODS
The disposal method determines how the program displaying the image should
treat the image after it's displayed, before writing the next image.

There are currently four possible options:

	none	No disposal specified. The default.
	not	Do not dispose. The next image will overlay this one.
	
	back	Restore to background color.  Fill the image's space with
                the previous background color. May cause flicker.

	prev	Restore to previous, restores the data from the previous frame.



BUGS

   + should be able to specify delay in an 'incfile' list (see next bug).

   + Does not handle filenames starting with a - (hypen), except in 'incfile'.

   + Needs better documentation.


TODO

   + Only save colormaps that are different from preceeding ones.

   + have an option that compares current image with previous and then
     only save the smallest rectangle that encompasses changes. I need sample
     code- the most efficient algorithms are patented?

   + option for luma sorting of colormaps

   + define extension block in order to have frame lists.
