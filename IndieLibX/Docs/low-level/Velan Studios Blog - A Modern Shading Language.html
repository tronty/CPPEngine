<p>High-level shading languages (GLSL, HLSL, MetalSL, etc...) are one of
 the few areas in games and graphics programming that, despite their 
name,
are still very low level and have evaded tighter, more meaningful 
integration with applications. There have been past attempts to provide
richer semantic information, but those are largely couched in the realm 
of being wrappers over an existing language: e.g. FX and Cg. The 
biggest issue with this approach is that the semantic information isn't a
 first-class citizen of the language. These wrappers are just
fancy variations on the C preprocessor, which by definition makes them 
lossy. What we really want is a language that has application-level
semantics built into it. Let's start by examining why, especially 
through the lens of game development.</p>

<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>Many game developers make games for multiple platforms. Some of them 
stay in the safe zone of Windows, PS4, and Xbox One. This is really
beneficial from a shader standpoint because HLSL (or a close variant 
thereof) can be used on all three of these platforms. In a lot
of cases, the PC version won't have additional features that necessitate
 different shaders. That being said, there's still the possibility
that different hardware optimizations will be chosen for each, making 
platform-specific code necessary. There are also developers that
release games across a wider range of platforms, including iOS, Android,
 Linux, MacOS, etc. This brings in other shader languages
including desktop GLSL, GLSL ES, and Apple's Metal Shading Language. 
With this, the problem of supporting multiple platforms becomes
much more pressing. Whereas with the first situation you'd be able to 
just use #defines for blocks of platform-specific functionality, you now
need to either have some sort of conversion pipeline, or manually author
 multiple, platform-specific shaders.</p>

<p>Fortunately, for developers that just need something to work right now, there's a rich ecosystem of solutions for shader
conversion and cross-compilation:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/aras-p/hlsl2glslfork">hlsl2glslfork</a> - (now outdated) Converts DX9 HLSL to various types of GLSL. The best that was available for a long time.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/Thekla/hlslparser">HLSLParser</a> - 
Originally written by Unknown Worlds for Natural Selection 2, converts 
DX9 HLSL to DX10 HLSL, GLSL, and Metal Shading Language.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/HLSLcc">HLSLcc</a> - What Unity uses for shader conversion now. Converts HLSL bytecode to GLSL, GLSL ES, Vulkan GLSL, and Metal Shading Language.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glslang">glslang</a> - Tool for converting GLSL to SPIR-V. HLSL front-end is in development.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-Cross">SPIRV-Cross</a> - Converts SPIR-V to GLSL, Metal Shading Language, and in the future, HLSL.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/aras-p/glsl-optimizer">glsl-optimizer</a> - Optimizes GLSL code, and can also translate GLSL to Metal Shading Language.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Where Existing Solutions Fall Flat</h3>
<p>There's a couple problems with the above solutions. The first is that
 cross-platform support isn't really there. Things like pixel-local 
storage
and framebuffer fetch are encoded through specific usage patterns 
instead of with function calls. This is honestly a terrible approach 
because
it requires knowledge of something with a magical outcome: i.e. a given,
 very specific configuration will translate into the desired usage in
the output, but it must match exactly. It also means that the language 
semantics need to be further overloaded to work with future
platform-specific extensions. The second problem is that HLSL is largely
 viewed as the "right" language to use as the input language. While
I definitely agree that it has better syntax and semantics than GLSL, 
it's not without its own problems, especially with regards to type
safety and safety in general. Additionally, the existence of wrappers 
like Cg and FX should make it obvious that HLSL doesn't have any real 
application-level facilities. What I mean by application-level is 
features for users that aid in developing applications: e.g. support for
variations of a shader with/without a given feature (henceforth called 
"variants"), material-level features (stuff like constant buffer
header creation/serialization), and render-pass level features 
(techniques). These are all possible in some form in FX and Cg, but
they're not tightly integrated and instead applied as a layer above the 
shader code itself.</p>

<h3>Managing Complexity</h3>
<p>The last aspect of all of this, largely motivated by prior experience
 with a codebase of very complicated shaders with many
variants controlled by boolean feature definitions, is a desire to 
discourage use of the preprocessor as much as possible. It's a rather
natural leap to want to control enabling/disabling features of a shader 
through the use of preprocessor definitions, especially since the
preprocessor is the most powerful metaprogramming tool that current 
shading languages have available. The problem with this is that it's 
a lossy transformation. Let's say you want to know what samplers and 
uniform buffers are used by a given configuration of a shader. Using the
preprocessor for variants means that you'll need to build and then 
reflect the information from every single variant, the union of which is
the information that you wanted to know. If your shader has thousands of
 variants you'll need to compile all of them just to get this
information, meaning that your shader build is potentially now a 
bottleneck for your material build.</p>

<p>The alternative here is having variants be a first-class citizen of 
the language, such that an un-varianted version of a shader already
represents the union of all possible shaders that can be generated from 
it. In practice, this means having some type called Variant that
the user uses like any other type (with some semantic restrictions).</p>

<p>An additional aspect of having extra semantic information in the 
shader is that we can even strip unnecessary vertex inputs based on
their usage in the pipeline. For example, if texture mapping is an 
optional feature, we can strip not only the code to do the texture
fetches from the pixel shader, but also the code to read/copy/generate 
the texture coordinates themselves from the vertex shader. This same
idea extends naturally into deeper pipelines which include geometry or 
tessellation shaders. In current systems, this can be achieved through 
having defines in vertex input structures to eliminate elements. In this
 system, it would be automatic and would require no additional work 
besides the user varianting the code in the pixel shader.</p>

<h3>What We Want In a Language</h3>
<p>In light of all of this, I propose writing a new high-level language, designed around some core tenets:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Strong, static typing.</li>
  <li>Include/module system.</li>
  <li>Familiar syntax for C/C++ developers.</li>
  <li>Platform-specific constructs represented in a uniform way (through intrinsics).</li>
  <li>Variants as a first-class language construct.</li>
  <li>Abstract intermediate representation.</li>
  <li>Ability to transpile to many different platform languages from a single source unit.</li>
  <li>Human-readable transpiled output (to aid debugging).</li>
</ol>

<p>If we look to the design of Apple's Metal Shading Language (from a 
software engineering standpoint), it fits the first four points pretty 
well.
The reason for this is that it's a modified subset of C++ parsed with a 
special version of Clang. I propose that this is currently the best
direction to go in when developing this new language: a modified subset 
of C++, parsed by an existing, well-tested parser (Clang). I imagine the
 
pipeline as looking like [Clang] -&gt; [Abstract Representation] -&gt; 
[Backend Transpilers].</p>

<h3>What an Intermediate Representation Gets Us</h3>
<p>Since we'd have an intermediate representation, there are all sorts of interesting things that could be done:</p>
<ul>
  <li>An actual module system with transpile/link-time optimization.</li>
  <li>Node-based shader editor that uniformly mixes user code and engine/tool-provided shader nodes.</li>
  <li>Output to non-GPU languages such as actual C++. This enables 
having a software rasterizer that has feature parity with a GPU 
rasterizer,
  with little to no additional effort on the part of the shader authors.</li>
  <li>Perform optimizations that aren't currently possible in 
platform-level languages due to missing or incomplete semantic 
information.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Hopefully I've made clear the case for having a shader language 
beyond what the various platform langauges offer, and moving to an 
authoring
model that treats the platform-level shading languages as something akin
 to assembly: a low-level language to compile to rather than author 
directly. There are definitely benefits beyond what I've outlined that 
this approach offers and having control over the language (versus 
dealing
with a platform/API vendor) opens the door to implementing high-level 
constructs that the platform vendors wouldn't consider approaching.</p>
