						<p>I often read people claiming that GameWorks is unfair to AMD, 
because they don’t get access to the sourcecode, and therefore they 
cannot optimize for it. I cringe everytime I read this, because it is 
wrong on so many levels. So I decided to write a blog about it, to 
explain how it REALLY works.</p>
<p>The first obvious mistake is that although GPUOpen itself may be open
 source, the games that use it are not. What this means is that when a 
game decides to use an open source library, the code is basically 
‘frozen in time’ as soon as they build the binaries, which you 
eventually install when you want to play the game. So even though you 
may have the source code for the effect framework, what are you going to
 do with it? You do not have the ability to modify the game code (eg DRM
 and/or anti-cheat will prevent you from doing this). So if the game 
happens to be unoptimized for a given GPU, there is nothing you can do 
about it, even if you do have the source.</p>
<p>The second obvious mistake is the assumption that you need the source
 code to see what an effect does. This is not the case, and in fact, in 
the old days, GPU vendors generally did not have access to the source 
code anyway (it might sound crazy, but in the old days, game developers 
actually developed games, as in, they developed the whole renderer and 
engine. Hardware suppliers supplied the hardware). These days, they have
 developer relations programs, and tend to work with developers more 
closely, which also involves getting access to source code in some cases
 (sometimes to the point where the GPU vendor actually does some/a lot 
of the hard work for them). But certainly not always (especially when 
the game is under the banner of the competing GPU vendor, such as Gaming
 Evolved or The Way It’s Meant To Be Played).</p>
<p>So, assuming you don’t get access to the source code, is there 
nothing you can do? Well no, on the contrary. In most cases, games and 
effect frameworks (even GameWorks) generally just perform standard 
Direct3D or OpenGL API calls. There are various game development tools 
available to analyze D3D or OpenGL code. For example, there is Visual 
Studio Graphics Diagnostics: <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh873207.aspx" rel="nofollow">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh873207.aspx</a></p>
<p>Basically, every game developer already has the tools to study which 
API calls are made, which shaders are run, which textures and geometry 
are used, how long every call takes etc. Since AMD and nVidia develop 
these Direct3D and OpenGL drivers themselves, they can include even more
 debugging and analysis options into their driver, if they so choose.</p>
<p>So in short, it is basically quite trivial for a GPU vendor to 
analyze a game, find the bottlenecks, and then optimize the driver for a
 specific game or effect (you cannot modify the game, as stated, so you 
have to modify the driver, even if you would have the source code). The 
source code isn’t even very helpful with this, because you want to find 
the bottlenecks, and it’s much easier to just run the code through an 
analysis-tool than it is to study the code and try to deduce which parts
 of the code will be the biggest bottlenecks on your hardware.</p>
<p>The only time GPU vendors actually want/need access to the source 
code is when they want to make fundamental changes to how&nbsp;a game 
works, either to improve performance, or to fix some bug. But even then,
 they don’t literally need access to the source code, they need the 
developer to change the code for them and release a patch to their 
users. Sometimes this requires taking the developer by the hand through 
the source code, and making sure they change what needs to be changed.</p>
<p>So the next time you hear someone claiming that GameWorks is unfair 
because AMD can’t optimize for it, please tell them they’re wrong, and 
explain why.</p>

<p>“So the next time you hear someone claiming that GameWorks is unfair

<p>Y’know, explaining technical nuances to the average fanboy, 
specifically an AMD fanboy, is like trying to play checkers with a 
monkey – it is only a matter of time until he flips the board over, and 
starts flinging poop at you. :p</p>

			<div class="comment-body"><p>Yea… AMD and nVidia are doing the same 
thing… AMD just packages it in a way that the average fanboy doesn’t 
catch on to it, apparently.</p>
<p>Or actually, they’re not *quite* doing the same thing… nVidia 
actually gets stuff done, where AMD mostly talks about it. I wonder how 
things will go this time, with VR being the ‘hot new thing’. AMD has 
talked about how Polaris is ‘great for VR’… But they haven’t explained 
why. At the same time, nVidia didn’t just give us Pascal and a bunch of 
hollow marketing talk about VR. No, Pascal can actually do stereoscopic 
rendering in a single pass, to up to 16 different viewports with 
different projections, and they actually gave us some OpenGL extensions,
 some NVAPI calls for D3D, and some example code in VRWorks (wait, 
giving code, wasn’t that something to do with ‘Open’?).<br>
I really hope AMD has something technical for VR in store as well, and 
it’s not just “Oh, our GPU can’t do anything the previous generation 
couldn’t, but look, it’s cheaper!”</p>

<p>Yes, if you want to run your company into the ground. Look how well it’s working for them on the CPU side.<br>
If you don’t keep up with new features, and if you can’t match or exceed
 the efficiency of your competitor, in the end you’re always going to 
lose. Because it’s costing you more than your competitor to keep those 
prices low. You’re bleeding your company dry.</p>

			<div class="comment-body"><p>• Performance/$ is an important metric, 
especially for the average user. The problem for AMD has always been, 
that the average user also demands a product that does everything 
out-of-the-box with minimal hassle or any need for tweaking the driver 
settings. That is where Nvidia has always beaten them, perf/$ or not.</p>
<p>• The 480s will be “made for VR”, just like the 390s were “made for 
4K” – just a bunch of marketing porn that gets passed around at the 
“team red” circle-jerk.</p>
<p>• Also, I think it is a bit ironic, how the AMD of the past used to 
mock Intel for “boasting about the GHz”, as the AMD of the present seems
 to be all about the GFLOP. <img draggable="false" class="emoji" alt="😀" src="GameWorks%20vs%20GPUOpen:%20closed%20vs%20open%20does%20not%20work%20the%20way%20you%20think%20it%20does%20%7C%20Scali%27s%20OpenBlog%E2%84%A2_tiedostot/1f600.svg"></p>

<p>Yes, but the advantage always goes to the vendor with the most 
efficient architecture. By the looks of it, Pascal is going to deliver 
better performance-per-watt/performance-per-transistor than Polaris. The
 result is that nVidia can get the same level of performance from a 
smaller/cheaper piece of silicon (and/or cheaper PCB, cooler etc, 
because there’s lower power draw, less heat to dissipate etc).<br>
So when it comes to putting a price on these parts (price is a 
completely arbitrary metric of course), nVidia can choose to price their
 products very aggressively, so that they get minimal profit on these 
parts (they can make up for it in the segments where AMD is not 
competing at all, such as the 1070/1080 and beyond). AMD then has no 
choice but to match or undercut nVidia’s price, but since their parts 
are more expensive to manufacture, that means they will have no profit 
at all.<br>
Which is pretty much what AMD has been doing on the CPU market for years
 now, and by the looks of it, since the launch of Maxwell, they are in 
that same position on the GPU-market as well.</p>
<p>Given the pricedrops we’re currently seeing on the 970, it looks like
 NVidia had a healthy profit margin on these parts, simply because they 
could. There was no competition. They can now drop it to more aggressive
 pricing, and compete with Polaris until the 1050/1060 come around, 
which will probably deliver about the same performance at about the same
 price, but are cheaper to manufacture, so nVidia’s profits go back up 
in that segment. Making it ever more difficult for AMD to invest into 
their next generation (as we’ve already seen with their past few 
releases. A lot of rebadging, lack of innovation, lack of progress in 
terms of efficiency).</p>
<p>Of course, MS and Sony are bleeding AMD dry on the console market as 
well. It looks like AMD wanted the console deals at all costs, 
literally. There just isn’t any money coming in.</p>

<p>Can you elaborate on this? I’ve looked at AMD’s last few quarterly 
reports and their semi-custom segment haven’t had an operating loss. The
 semi-custom does include other items such as server/embedded 
processors, but I would guess game consoles still make up a large 
portion of it. To me it looks like semi-custom is doing a good job.</p>

			<div class="comment-body"><p>Well, there’s a difference between “no operating loss” and making a good profit.<br>
MS and Sony sell millions of consoles. You’d think such a large deal 
would be able to keep the company afloat, but no, it does not.<br>
In fact, if we look here:<br>
<a href="http://www.amd.com/en-us/press-releases/Pages/press-release-2016apr21.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.amd.com/en-us/press-releases/Pages/press-release-2016apr21.aspx</a><br>
“The decreases were primarily driven by lower sales of semi-custom SoCs.”<br>
Looks like that segment is going down the drain as well.</p>

			<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>If I understand correctly,

<p>I don’t know if that’s true (as far as I know, the code needs to 
integrate deep into your own engine. You can’t just ‘tack on’ effects 
with a library, they need to integrate deep into your pipeline, with 
your rendering algorithms, geometry and pixel formats etc. But perhaps 
there are special cases for well-known engines). But that’s not the 
point.<br>
Most games these days have protection against tampering with their files (both to protect from piracy and cheating).<br>
So even if you could build your own lib, the game wouldn’t accept 
anything other than the original file. The only way to replace the lib 
is if the developer issues it as an official update. Which they won’t 
do, because they used GPUOpen because AMD paid them to do so in the 
first place. That’s “Gaming Evolved”, exactly like “GameWorks”.</p>
<blockquote><p>More over, Steam actually does that: upon installing a 
game, if Steams finds in the system particular library (e.g. from 
repository), it won’t download it with the game.</p></blockquote>
<p>Only for generic libraries like DirectX or OpenAL. And even then 
usually the games still downloads and run the installers, the installers
 just don’t install older files. Libraries that are considered part of 
the game (as GPUOpen would be, as it’s tweaked specifically for each 
game), will be installed in the game directory.</p>
