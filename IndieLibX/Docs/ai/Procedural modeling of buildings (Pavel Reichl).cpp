It looks like the document discusses procedural modeling techniques, including the implementation of a CGA (Computer-Generated Architecture) shape grammar for generating buildings in a procedural manner, specifically for a Blender plug-in.

If you'd like me to generate C++ code based on this content, please clarify which part you want implemented. For example:

    Shape grammar implementation.
    Procedural building generator.
    Specific rule functions (e.g., Split, Repeat, etc.).

Let me know, and I'll proceed accordingly!

To implement the C++ code related to procedural modeling of buildings described in the document, I can extract key elements such as rule-based grammar, scope management, and shape generation to fit within a typical C++ framework. Are you looking for a basic example that demonstrates shape grammar processing, or do you want a full procedural building generator? Please provide guidance on the scope and complexity of the implementation.
