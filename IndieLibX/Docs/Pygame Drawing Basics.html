<h1>PyGame Drawing Basics</h1>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>You must do the following to get started with Pygame:</p>
<pre>import pygame
import sys


pygame.init()

</pre>
<p>Strictly speaking, import sys is not needed for PyGame, but as we'll 
see later, to be able to use the "close window" button on Windows or 
Mac, we'll need to use sys.exit(), so it is helpful.</p>
<h2>Opening a Window</h2>
<p>To open a window of size 640,480, use the statement below. </p>
<pre>screen = pygame.display.set_mode((640,480))

</pre>
<ul>
  <li>This opens a window of  size 640,480, and stores it in a variable called <code>screen</code></li>
  <li>Substitute other numbers for other sizes of screeen.</li>
  <li>You have to pass this variable anytime you want to do something to the screen</li>
</ul>
<h2>The screen</h2>
<p>If your screen is of size 640,480:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The point (0,0) is at the upper left hand corner of the screen.</li>
  <li>x coordinates increase from left to right, y coordinates increase from top to bottom</li>
  <li>So:
    <ul>
        <li>Upper right is (640,0)</li>
      <li>Lower left is (0,480)</li>
      <li>Lower right is (640,480)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Updating the Screen</h2>
<p>Changes you make to the screen—e.g. filling it with color, or drawing on it—do <em><strong>not</strong></em> show up immediately!</p>
<p>Instead, you have to call this function </p>
<pre>pygame.display.update()

</pre>
<ul>
  <li>pygame.display.update() shows you all the drawing you did since  the last call to pygame.display.update()</li>
  <li>if this is the first call to pygame.display.update(), it is all changes since the screen was created</li>
</ul>
<p>Why do you have to do this? </p>
<ul>
  <li>This implements a features called double buffering</li>
  <li>Double buffering is a feature of PyGame (and many other game 
programming packages) that lets you make lots of changes to the screen, 
and then have them all show up together as a single frame.</li>
  <li>Otherwise, when there is fast animation, the screen would "flicker" and it would be annoying to people playing the game</li>
</ul>
<h2>Colors</h2>
<pre>colorName = (r,g,b)</pre>
<ul>
  <li>name the color anything you like.</li>
  <li>(r,g,b) is a tuple with values for red, green, and blue<br>
  </li>
  <li>all three should be integers between 0 and 255, with 255 being brightest, and 0 being darkest</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples:</p>
<pre>red = (255,0,0)
green = (0,255,0)
blue = (0,0,255)
darkBlue = (0,0,128)
white = (255,255,255)
black = (0,0,0)
pink = (255,200,200)</pre>
<h2>Drawing</h2>
<p>Remember that after you draw, you have to call pygame.display.update() before your changes show up.</p>
<pre>screen.fill(color)</pre>
<ul>
  <li>fills the entire screen with the given color</li>
  <li>e.g. <code>screen.fill(white)</code></li>
</ul>
<pre>pygame.draw.lines(screen, color, closed, pointlist, thickness)
</pre>


<ul>
  <li>draws a series of lines, connecting the points specified in pointlist</li>
  <li>pointlist is a list of tuples, specifying a series of points, e.g.
 to draw a V you might use [(100,100), (150,200), (200,100)], with 
closed = False</li>
  <li>closed should be either True or False, indicating whether to connect the last point back to the first</li>
  <li>thickness is the thickness of the line (in pixels).</li>
  <li>Example: 
  <code>pygame.draw.lines(screen, black, False, [(100,100), (150,200), (200,100)], 1)</code></li>
</ul>
<pre>
pygame.draw.rect(screen, color, (x,y,width,height), thickness)</pre>
<ul>
  <li>draws a rectangle</li>
  <li>(x,y,width,height) is a Python tuple</li>
  <li>x,y are the coordinates of the upper left hand corner </li>
  <li>width, height are the width and height of the rectangle</li>
  <li>thickness is the thickness of the line. If it is zero, the rectangle is filled</li>
</ul>
<pre>pygame.draw.circle(screen, color, (x,y), radius, thickness)</pre>
<ul>
  <li>draws a circle</li>
  <li>(x,y) is a Python tuple for the center, radius is the radius</li>
  <li>thickness is the thickness of the line. If it is zero, the rectangle is filled</li>
</ul>
<pre>pygame.draw.arc(screen, color, (x,y,width,height), start_angle, stop_angle, thickness)</pre>
<ul>
  <li>draws an arc (portion of an ellipse)</li>
  <li>(x,y,height,width) are the coordinates of a rectangle that the arc would fit inside if it were drawn all the way around</li>
  <li>if height and width are equal, then the rectangle is a square, and the arc will be a portion of a circle</li>
  <li>start_angle and stop_angle are the angle on the unit circle in radians (not degrees) where the arc stops and starts</li>
  <li>An example is shown in this Python file:  <a href="http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~pconrad/cs5nm/08F/ex/ex09/drawCircleArcExample.py">drawCircleArcExample.py</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Writing your own drawing functions</h2>
<p>You can use functions to help you draw in PyGame in two different ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Create your own specialized drawing functions</li>
  <li>Create functions that return lists of points</li>
</ul>
<h3>Specialized Drawing Functions (as in <a href="http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~pconrad/cs5nm/08F/ex/ex06.html">ex06</a>)</h3>
<p>The first way is illustrated below. This function actually draws a 
house. First it forms a list of points, and then it uses them to draw 
the house by calling <code>pygame.draw.lines()</code></p>
<pre>def drawHouse(x, y, width, height, screen, color):
    points = [(x,y- ((2/3.0) * height)), (x,y), (x+width,y), (x+width,y-(2/3.0) * height), 
        (x,y- ((2/3.0) * height)), (x + width/2.0,y-height), (x+width,y-(2/3.0)*height)]
    lineThickness = 2
    pygame.draw.lines(screen, color, False, points, lineThickness)</pre>
<h3>Functions that return lists of points (as in <a href="http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~pconrad/cs5nm/08F/ex/ex09.html">ex09</a>)</h3>
<p>The second way is illustrated below. First, we have a function that creates the list of points:</p>
<pre>def makeHouseFrame(x,y,width,height):
   points = [] # start with an empty list
   points.append((x,y- ((2/3.0) * height))) # top of 1st story, upper left
   points.append((x,y))  # lower left corner
   points.append((x+width,y)) # lower right corner
   points.append((x+width,y-(2/3.0) * height)) # top of 1st story upper right
   points.append((x,y- ((2/3.0) * height))) # top of first story, upper left
   points.append((x + width/2.0,y-height)) # top of roof
   points.append((x+width,y-(2/3.0)*height)) # top of 1st story, upper right
   return points</pre>
<p>Then, we can just use those points to draw a house like this. </p>
<pre>def drawHouse(x,y,width,height,screen,color):
 &nbsp;&nbsp;lineThickness = 2 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;pygame.draw.lines(screen, color, False,
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;makeHouseFrame(x,y,height,width), lineThickness)</pre>
<p>Note that we have a function call to <code>makeHouseFrame()</code> as the fourth argument to the <code>pygame.draw.lines()</code> function call. </p>
<ul>
  <li>The call to <code>makeHouseFrame()</code> returns a list of points</li>
  <li>That list of points is what we draw whenever <code>drawHouse() </code>is called</li>
  <li>So, a call to <code>drawHouse() </code>results in a call to <code>makeHouseFrame() </code>to return a list of points, which is then passed in to <code>pygame.draw.lines()</code></li>
</ul>
<h3>Comparing the two techniques</h3>
<p>At first, it may  seem like this is <em><strong>not </strong></em>progress. We've turned a simple five line function into two functions, and fourteen lines of code—that do the very same thing.T</p>
<p>This seems to go against the idea that "simple is better than complex".</p>
<p>However, the second version has several advantages:</p>
<ul>
  <li>We list the points one at a time in the makeHouseFrame() function.
    <ul>
      <li>That gives us a chance to put a comment next to each point.</li>
      <li> That can help <em><strong>a lot </strong></em>when we are having trouble figuring out what is going on.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>We can use check_expect() to write test cases for makeHouseFrame() to see if the list of points returned is correct or not
    <ul>
      <li>For an example of this, see the file <a href="http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~pconrad/cs5nm/08F/ex/ex09/ex09DrawHousesWithTests.py">ex09DrawHousesWithTests.py</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>When we add additional features to the house, like doors, windows, etc. we can put each of these in its own function.
    <ul>
      <li>That keeps the drawHouse function shorter and easier to understand</li>
      <li>We might also be able to reuse some things—for example, we 
might find a way to draw multiple windows on a single house if we define
 our makeWindowPoints function in the correct way.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Restructuring our code like this is an example of "refactoring" (discussed in <a href="http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~pconrad/thinkpython/html/book005.html#toc45">section 4.7 of the textbook</a>)</p>
<h2>Enabling the quit button (red X on Windows, red circle on Mac)</h2>
<p>To make the quit button work, we need two things:</p>
<ol>
  <li>An infinite loop, that goes around and around looking for events</li>
  <li>Some code that looks for a QUIT event, and handles that event</li>
</ol>
<p>The infinite loop part is easy. Here is an infinite loop in Python:</p>
<pre>while (True):
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# do something</pre>
<p>Whatever we have in place of <code>#&nbsp;do&nbsp;something</code> will be done over and over again, until we exit the program.</p>
<p>What is it that we want to do over and over? Each time through the 
loop, we need to look for quit events and if we find one, we need to 
quit the program:</p>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for event in pygame.event.get():
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pygame.quit(); sys.exit();</pre>
<p>This code says the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The call to pygame.event.get() returns a list of every event that 
has happened since we called pygame.init(), or since the last call to 
pygame.event.get().</li>
  <li>One by one, the variable event is set to each of those events.</li>
  <li>For each one of those, we use an if test to see if that event is equal to <code>pygame.QUIT</code> which is a value that means that the user clicked the red X (or red Circle) to close the window</li>
  <li>If the user did that, then do two things:
    <ul>
      <li>Call <code>pygame.quit()</code> to shut down pygame (this includes closing the window)</li>
      <li>Call <code>sys.exit()</code> to shut down the program (this exits the infinite loop)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>We put this code inside a <code>while&nbsp;(True):</code> infinite 
loop so that we can do it over and over again—we have to keep doing it, 
because we don't know when the user will click the red X.</p>
<h2>Animation (making drawings move)</h2>
<p>To make a drawing move, you just put code inside your infinite loop that </p>
<ul>
  <li>erases the old drawing (e.g. <code>screen.fill(white)</code> or <code>screen.fill(black)</code>)</li>
  <li>draws the new drawing (e.g. using  function calls starting with <code>pygame.draw</code>) in a <strong><em>different place</em></strong> than it was before!</li>
  <li>calls <code>pygame.display.update() </code>to make all the changes appear</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember:</p>
<ul>
  <li> All the changes in between two to pygame.display.update() show up <em><strong>all at once</strong></em> as a new frame (just like a new frame in a movie)</li>
  <li>So, you can create the illusion of smooth motion</li>
</ul>
<p>So you have something like this:</p>
<pre>while (True):<br><br>   # check for quit events<br>   for event in pygame.event.get():
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pygame.quit(); sys.exit();<br><br>   # erase the screen<br>   screen.fill(white)<br><br>   # draw the updated picture<br><br>   updatePoints(points)  # changes the location of the points<br>   pygame.draw.lines(screen,black,false,points,1)  # redraw the points

   # update the screen<br>   pygame.display.update()</pre>
<h2 style="page-break-before:always">Making the motion go faster or slower</h2>
<p>There are at least two ways to make the motion go faster or slower</p>
<p>One simple way to slow things down is to insert a call to<code> pygame.time.delay(5) </code>somewhere inside the loop—the number is the number of milliseconds to delay.</p>
<p>A better way is to use a clock.</p>
<p>To use a clock:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Put the code <code>clock = pygame.time.Clock() </code>near the start of the program, somewhere after <code>pygame.init()</code> but definitely outside the main loop</li>
  <li>Inside the loop, put the code <code>msElapsed&nbsp;=&nbsp;clock.tick(30)</code> where 30 is the frame rate you want (e.g. 30 frames per second)</li>
</ol>
<h2>Smoother Motion</h2>
<p>If you want to get really fancy, and make your motion as smooth an as
 accurate as possible, you can check the value of msElapsed, which will 
tell you how much time elapsed since the last call to clock.tick(30).</p>
<p>In theory, it should be close to 1000.0/30.0 milliseconds.  In 
practice it might be more or less, depending on the load on your 
machine.</p>
<p>You can use to value of msElapsed to determine how far to move your drawing. </p>
<ul>
  <li>You can have a target speed in "pixels per second".</li>
  <li>You use msElapsed/1000.0 to determine how many seconds have elapsed</li>
  <li>The use that to determine how far, in pixels, your drawing should have moved during this frame.</li>
</ul>
