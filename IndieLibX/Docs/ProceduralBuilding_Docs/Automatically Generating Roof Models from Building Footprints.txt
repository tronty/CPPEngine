Modelling Large Urban Environments using traditional modelling techniques would prove too time consuming a
process. Consequently a method is required for generating large urban environments quickly without requiring a
labour intensive process or expensive data. Some approaches to resolve this problem have been undertaken
through the use of procedural modelling or statistics. However the test subject is usually a dense urban
environment where the primary buildings are of the skyscraper style. This paper presents the initial design and
implementation towards a method for modelling a large environment based on building footprint information. It
shows the use of the straight skeleton method with modifications to allow several different roof styles to be
generated.
