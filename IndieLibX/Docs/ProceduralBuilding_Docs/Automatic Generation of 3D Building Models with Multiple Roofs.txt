       CG integrated system that automatically generates 3D building models with multiple roofs. Most building
       polygons’ edges meet at right angles (orthogonal polygon). The integrated system partitions orthogonal
       building polygons into a set of rectangles and places rectangular roofs and box-shaped building bodies on
       these rectangles. In order to partition an orthogonal polygon, we proposed a useful polygon expression in
       deciding from which vertex a dividing line is drawn. In this paper, we propose a new scheme for partitioning
       building polygons and show the process of creating 3D roof models.

Introduction
Based on building footprints or building polygons on
digital maps (Fig. 1), we are proposing the GIS and
CG integrated system that automatically generates 3D
building models with multiple roofs. A 3D urban
model (Fig. 2) is an important information infrastruc-                    Fig. 1   Building polygons on a digital map

scape evaluation and urban planning, disaster preven-
tion simulation, tourism, and many other business
practices. In addition, disclosure of information about
public projects such as city planning or historic build-
ings restoration to the public to encourage their par-
ticipation is a new application area where a 3D city
model can be of great use. To facilitate “public in-
volvement”, 3D models simulating a real city can be of
great use.
