# Commands below in this file and on the file ./install_.sh were tested on following operating systems:
# 	macOS High Sierra (64-bit) (any other version of 64-bit macOS may also do as well)
# 	Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS Bionic Beaver (32-bit and 64-bit)
# 	Linux Mint 19.1 "Tessa"  - Cinnamon (32-bit and 64-bit)
# 	Linux Mint 19.2 "Tina" 	 - Cinnamon (32-bit and 64-bit) also now available should do equally well
# 	Linux Mint 19.3 "Tricia" - Cinnamon (32-bit and 64-bit) also now available should do equally well
# 	Linux Mint 20 	"Ulyana" - Cinnamon (64-bit) also now available should do equally well
# 	I use currently mainly Linux Mint 19.1 "Tessa" - Cinnamon where there is the LightDM as a display manager
# 	and system snapshots are available on update manager
# 	(may save time if the system breaks and must be restored to a some previous state)
