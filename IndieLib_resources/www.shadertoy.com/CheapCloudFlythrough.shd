	Cheap Cloud Flythrough 
	----------------------
	
	"Cheap" should probably refer to the quality of the physics in this shader, which is
	virtually non-existent, but it actually refers to the fake cloud algorithm... if you could 
	call it that. :)
	
	This is merely an attempt to give the impression of a cloud flythrough, whilst maintaining	
	a reasonably acceptable framerate. The key to that is keeping the distance field as simple 
	as possible.

	Due to the amount of cost cutting, it's far from  perfect. However, there's still plenty 
	of room for improvement.

    I've used density based accumulation, which in one way or another, uses concepts from many 
	volumetric examples, but particularly from the following:
	
	Cloudy Spikeball - Duke
    https://www.shadertoy.com/view/MljXDw
    // Port from a demo by Las - Worth watching.
    // http://www.pouet.net/topic.php?which=7920&page=29&x=14&y=9
    
    Other shaders worth looking at:

	Clouds - IQ: One of my favorite shaders, and everyone elses, it seems.
	https://www.shadertoy.com/view/XslGRr
		
	Sample Pinning - huwb: Fast, and pretty.
	https://www.shadertoy.com/view/XdfXzn
	
	FakeVolumetricClouds - Kuvkar: Fast, using parallax layers. Really cool.
	https://www.shadertoy.com/view/XlsXzN

    Emission clouds - Duke: Nice, and straight forward.
