         software do not infringe the rights, including patent, copyright and trade secret rights,

         but not sold, leased or in any other way passed on to a third party (with the exception of 5.1)

         to be agreed upon or expressly waived in a written statement by 21st.

            industry standard measures which assure that the models are not by any simple means
            extractable by third parties. 21st acknowledges that such measures may not be perfect
            and that developers are not responsible for third party malversations, if any damages
            to 21st큦 rights can be proven to be originated by third party manipulations.
            Developers of applications which can reasonably be expected to be sold or in any
            other way spread more than 50 times must apply to 21st for special conditions/contracts,
            if the expectations are surpassed later the conditions have to be adapted to 21sts demands.

            21st or their partners, while sheer animationsr and 2D pictures are absolutely
