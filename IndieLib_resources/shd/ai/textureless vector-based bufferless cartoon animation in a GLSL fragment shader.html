Creating a textureless, vector-based, bufferless cartoon animation directly in a GLSL fragment shader involves a series of steps that leverage procedural rendering techniques rather than traditional rasterized textures or geometry. Here's a breakdown of how you can approach this problem:

### Key Components:
1. **Procedural Shapes**: Since we're not using textures, everything is drawn procedurally. This means basic shapes like circles, rectangles, and lines need to be generated in the shader.
2. **Vector-Based Rendering**: For clean lines and shapes, you'll likely rely on mathematical definitions (like distance fields or functions) to draw shapes. SmoothStep or step functions can be used to achieve sharp edges for cartoon-like visual effects.
3. **Animation**: Time-based animation can be handled using GLSL’s `uniform float time` and manipulating the procedural shapes over time.
4. **Bufferless Rendering**: No off-screen framebuffers; rendering occurs entirely in the fragment shader based on screen coordinates (`gl_FragCoord`).

### Example GLSL Fragment Shader Structure

Here is a basic example of how you might begin building such an animation in GLSL. This shader draws a simple cartoon-style moving circle that acts as a character, with clean lines and no textures.

```glsl
#ifdef GL_ES
precision mediump float;
#endif

uniform float time; // Time uniform for animation
uniform vec2 resolution; // Screen resolution

// Function to create a smooth circle using signed distance fields (SDF)
float sdCircle(vec2 p, float r) {
    return length(p) - r;
}

// Function to create cartoon-style lines (edges for the cartoon effect)
float edge(float dist, float thickness) {
    return smoothstep(thickness - 0.01, thickness + 0.01, dist);
}

// Function to create a simple 2D transformation (translation)
vec2 translate(vec2 p, vec2 offset) {
    return p - offset;
}

void main() {
    // Normalize the coordinates
    vec2 uv = gl_FragCoord.xy / resolution.xy * 2.0 - 1.0;
    uv.x *= resolution.x / resolution.y;

    // Animation: Moving the circle horizontally
    float xMovement = sin(time) * 0.5;
    vec2 center = vec2(xMovement, 0.0);

    // Define the circle's radius
    float radius = 0.3;

    // Transform the uv space to move the circle
    uv = translate(uv, center);

    // Signed distance field for the circle
    float dist = sdCircle(uv, radius);

    // Color for the character (inside the circle)
    vec3 characterColor = vec3(0.1, 0.6, 1.0); // Blue

    // Background color
    vec3 backgroundColor = vec3(1.0); // White

    // Basic coloring based on distance field (inside the circle)
    vec3 color = mix(characterColor, backgroundColor, step(0.0, dist));

    // Adding an outline for the cartoon effect
    float edgeThickness = 0.02;
    float outline = edge(dist, edgeThickness);
    color = mix(vec3(0.0), color, outline);

    // Output the final color
    gl_FragColor = vec4(color, 1.0);
}
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Signed Distance Fields (SDF)**: The `sdCircle` function generates a distance field for a circle. This allows for smooth and scalable vector rendering of shapes like circles.
   
2. **Time-based Animation**: The `xMovement` variable creates a simple animation by oscillating the circle’s position horizontally using the `sin` function and the `time` uniform.

3. **Edge Function**: The `edge` function uses a `smoothstep` to create a crisp boundary around the circle, simulating the "line-art" style characteristic of cartoons.

4. **Procedural Translation**: The `translate` function is used to move the circle's center, controlled by the time-varying `xMovement`.

5. **Coloring**: Inside the circle is colored blue, and the background is white. The `mix` function blends these colors based on the signed distance field, ensuring smooth transitions.

6. **Cartoon Outline**: The outline effect is achieved using the distance field's boundary, with a thickness controlled by the `edgeThickness` parameter. This creates a bold black outline, similar to traditional cartoons.

### Expansion:
- **Complex Shapes**: More complex shapes (like rectangles or polygons) can be drawn with other signed distance functions or combinations of basic shapes.
- **More Animation**: You can add rotation, scaling, or even frame-by-frame style animation by manipulating the `uv` coordinates with more complex transformations.
- **Shading**: For more stylistic shading, like flat colors or gradient fills, you can adjust the fragment colors based on the position or introduce lighting effects.

### Conclusion:
This shader demonstrates how to create a textureless, bufferless, vector-based cartoon-style animation using GLSL's fragment shader. By using mathematical definitions of shapes (SDFs), you can build up more complex animations and render them directly within the shader, making it highly efficient and scalable for real-time applications like games or interactive visualizations.
